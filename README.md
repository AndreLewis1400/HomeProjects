=======
Program Specifications Write a program to play an automated game of Rock, Paper, Scissors. Two players make one of three hand signals at the same time. 
Hand signals represent a rock, a piece of paper, or a pair of scissors. Each combination results in a win for one of the players. Rock crushes scissors, paper covers rock, and scissors cut paper. 
A tie occurs if both players make the same signal. Use a random number generator of 0, 1, or 2 to represent the three signals.

Note: this program is designed for incremental development. Complete each step and submit for grading before starting the next step. Only a portion of tests pass after each step but confirm progress.
