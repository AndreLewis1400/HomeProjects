## Quick Navigation

### Current FIU Classes
- **[CAP4770 Data Mining](Classes/CAP4770_Data_Mining/)** - CAP4770: Data Mining (FIU) - Data analysis, machine learning, visualization, and mining techniques
- **[COP3350 Programming 1](Classes/COP3350_Programming_1/)** - COP3350: Programming 1 (FIU) - Java programming fundamentals, OOP concepts, and basic algorithms
- **[COP3530 Data Structures](Classes/COP3530_Data_Structures/)** - COP3530: Data Structures (FIU) - Arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and algorithms
- **[COP4338 Systems Programming](Classes/COP4338_Systems_Programming/)** - COP4338: Systems Programming (FIU) - C programming, system calls, file I/O, and low-level programming
- **[COP4610 Operating Systems](Classes/COP4610_Operating_Systems/)** - COP4610: Operating Systems (FIU) - Process management, memory management, file systems, synchronization, and IPC

### FIU Academic Organization Benefits
- **Centralized**: All FIU classes organized under one `Classes` directory
- **Consistent**: Each FIU class follows the same organizational structure
- **Scalable**: Easy to add new FIU classes and maintain organization
- **FIU-Ready**: Structure designed for FIU's academic requirements and grading standards

## Getting Started

1. **Navigate to a specific class**: `cd Classes/COP4610_Operating_Systems/`
2. **Browse assignments**: `cd Assignments/` to see all programming assignments
3. **Review labs**: `cd Labs/` for hands-on exercises
4. **Check projects**: `cd Projects/` for major implementations
5. **Study examples**: `cd Code_Examples/` for working code demonstrations

## Development Setup

- **Language**: C/C++ (primary)
- **Compiler**: GCC with C99/C++11 standard
- **Platform**: Linux/Unix environment
- **Tools**: GDB, valgrind, make
- **Version Control**: Git

## Adding New FIU Classes

When you start a new FIU class, follow this pattern:
1. Create a new directory: `Classes/COURSE_CODE_Class_Name/` (e.g., `Classes/COP3530_Data_Structures/`)
2. Use the standard FIU structure: Assignments/, Labs/, Projects/, Code_Examples/, Notes/, Resources/
3. Add a README.md file explaining the class content and FIU course information
4. Update this main README.md to include the new FIU class

## Benefits of This FIU Organization

- **Centralized Access**: All your FIU classes are organized in one place
- **Consistent Structure**: Each FIU class follows the same organizational pattern
- **Easy Navigation**: Clear directory structure with comprehensive README files
- **Scalable Design**: Easy to add new FIU classes as you progress through your degree
- **FIU Academic Standards**: Structure designed to meet FIU's academic requirements
- **Professional Organization**: Clean, maintainable structure for FIU coursework

## Next Steps

1. **Explore your organized FIU materials**: Navigate through the `Classes/` directory
2. **Add new FIU classes**: When you start new FIU courses, follow the established pattern
3. **Maintain organization**: Keep your FIU materials organized as you add new content
4. **Use the documentation**: Refer to README files for guidance and instructions
5. **Follow FIU guidelines**: Ensure all work meets FIU's academic standards
