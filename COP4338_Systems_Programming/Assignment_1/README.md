# Assignment 1: Pattern Checker

This program implements various pattern detection algorithms for string analysis.

## Features
The program can detect the following patterns:
- Palindromes: Strings that read the same forwards and backwards
- Arithmetic sequences: Consecutive letters in alphabetical order
- Singleton patterns: Strings with all identical characters
- Balanced bipartite strings: Strings that can be split into two identical parts
- Balanced tripartite strings: Strings that can be split into three identical parts

## Files
- `pattern_checker.c`: Main source code implementing the pattern detection logic
- `pa1.h`: Header file containing function declarations and implementations
- `Makefile`: Build configuration file

## Building the Program
To compile the program, run:
```bash
make
```

## Usage
After compilation, run the program with:
```bash
./pattern_finder
```
