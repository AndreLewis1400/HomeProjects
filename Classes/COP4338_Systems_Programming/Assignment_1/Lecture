Node Definition:
A struct node is defined to represent each element in the linked list, containing an integer value and a pointer to the next node.

Utility Functions:

to_str(node* head): Converts a linked list into a human-readable string (e.g., "1 -> 2 -> 3"), making it easy to print the list's contents.
construct_list(int arr[], int len): Builds a linked list from an array of integers, dynamically allocating memory for each node.
reverse(node** list_pointer): Reverses a linked list in-place by rearranging the next pointers.

Main Function:

Demonstrates manual creation of a short linked list (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4).
Shows how to build a longer list from an array.
Prints the lists using to_str.
Reverses the longer list and prints the result.
