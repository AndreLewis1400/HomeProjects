## FIU Organization Principles

1. **Consolidated Structure**: All FIU class materials are organized under a single `Classes` directory
2. **Consistent Naming**: Each FIU class follows the same organizational pattern (COURSE_CODE_Class_Name)
3. **Clear Separation**: Different types of work (assignments, labs, projects) are clearly separated
4. **Easy Navigation**: README files provide quick access to all FIU materials
5. **Scalable Design**: Structure supports adding new FIU classes easily
6. **FIU Standards**: Organization meets FIU's academic requirements and grading standards

## Usage

Navigate to any subdirectory to find specific FIU materials:
```bash
cd Classes/COP4610_Operating_Systems/Assignments/
cd Classes/COP4610_Operating_Systems/Labs/
cd Classes/COP4610_Operating_Systems/Projects/
```

## Adding New FIU Classes

When adding new FIU classes, follow this pattern:
1. Create a new directory under `Classes/` with the format: `COURSE_CODE_Class_Name`
2. Use the same subdirectory structure (Assignments, Labs, Projects, etc.)
3. Add a README.md file explaining the FIU class content and course information
4. Update this main README.md to include the new FIU class
5. Ensure all work meets FIU's academic standards and requirements
