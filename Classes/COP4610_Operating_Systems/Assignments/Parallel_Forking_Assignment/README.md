# COP4610 Parallel Forking Assignment

**Course**: COP4610 - Operating Systems (FIU)  
**Assignment**: Parallel Forking Assignment  
**Points**: 100 points total  
**Due Date**: [Check Canvas for due date]

## Assignment Overview

This assignment implements parallel execution in C using `fork()` to create child processes. Each child performs a different computational task and communicates results back to the parent process using inter-process communication (IPC).

## Assignment Requirements

### Part 1: Write the Program (55 pts)
- **User Input**: Program asks for number `n` (1-4) to determine child processes
- **Parent Message**: Parent displays message before creating children
- **Child Tasks**: Each child performs a unique computational task
- **IPC Communication**: Children send results to parent (no direct printing)
- **Parent Coordination**: Parent waits for all children and displays results
- **Compilation**: Code must compile successfully

### Part 2: Video Walkthrough (45 pts)
- **Task Explanation & Design Rationale** (10 pts)
- **Bugs & Debugging** (5 pts)
- **Online Resource or AI Use** (5 pts)
- **Communication Method Explained** (5 pts)
- **Diagram of Processes** (5 pts)
- **Live Code Demo** (5 pts)
- **Performance Comparison** (10 pts)
- **Peer Review** (10 pts)

```

## Quick Start

1. **Compile on Ocelot**:
   ```bash
   gcc -O2 -Wall -Wextra -o parallel_forking parallel_forking.c -lm
   ```

2. **Run the program**:
   ```bash
   ./parallel_forking 4
   ```

3. **Record your video** following the walkthrough guide

## Assignment Tasks

The program implements 4 unique computational tasks:

1. **Prime Counting**: Count primes ≤ 300,000
2. **Pi Approximation**: Leibniz series (~30M iterations)
3. **Matrix Multiplication**: 140×140 matrix multiply and sum
4. **Numerical Integration**: Integrate sin(x) on [0,π] with 60M slices

## Key Features

- **Process Management**: Uses `fork()` to create child processes
- **IPC**: One pipe per child for communication
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error checking
- **Timing**: Microsecond precision timing with `CLOCK_MONOTONIC`
- **Clean Output**: Parent-only printing, structured result display

## Grading Rubric Alignment
