# Final Verification - Manual Count

## From the Execution Output:

### Unique Process IDs:
1. **93835** - Original parent process
2. **93836** - Child from first fork()
3. **93837** - Parent's child from third fork()
4. **93838** - Grandchild from second fork()
5. **93840** - Child's child from third fork()
6. **93841** - Grandchild's child from third fork()

### Thread Creation:
- **THREAD CREATED in process 93836** (child from first fork)
- **THREAD CREATED in process 93838** (grandchild from second fork)

## Step-by-Step Logic:

### Initial State:
- 1 process: Original parent

### After First fork():
- 2 processes: Parent + Child

### After Second fork() (child only):
- 3 processes: Parent + Child + Grandchild

### After Third fork() (all processes):
- 6 processes: Parent + Child + Grandchild + 3 new children

### Thread Creation:
- Only processes that execute the if block create threads
- Child (from first fork) creates 1 thread
- Grandchild (from second fork) creates 1 thread
- Total: 2 threads

## Final Answer:
- **6 unique processes**
- **2 unique threads**

## Confirmation:
The execution trace shows exactly 6 different PIDs and 2 thread creation messages.
